2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Evaluation
4. Over-fitting, Under-fitting, and Model Selection
5. Ridge Regression
6. Grid Search

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/burhanahmed1/LaptopPricing-MachineLearning-Analysis.git
cd LaptopPricing-MachineLearning-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook:
